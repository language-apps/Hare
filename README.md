# HARE ([H]olistic [A]udio [R]ecorder and [E]ditor)

The HARE audio editor enables you to edit and manipulate sound files. You can copy or cut words and phrases to create new sound files. You can alter the volume of the recordings, and speed up or slow the play back. Additionally, you can add gloss(normally English) and native annotations to the recordings. The release supports any indigenous keyboard for annotations. HARE is also integrated into the ACORNS application. English, Cherokee and Chinook keyboards, but you can easily add other keyboards. The ACORNS project conforms to best practice criteria for working with linguistic data, in that it supports standard file formats through its export and import facilities. The second Sound Editor mode of operation, annotation mode, allows you to add up to ten levels of text annotations to any portion of a sound recording. This feature is integrated into ACORNS for creating a variety of language lessons (e.g., Story Book).
