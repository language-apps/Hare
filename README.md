The release supports any indigenous keyboard for annotations. It can work with any indigenous keyboard. HARE is integrated into the ACORNS application. All apps developed as part of the ACORNS project conform to best practice criteria for working with linguistic data, in that it supports standard file formats through its export and import facilities. A second Sound Editor mode of operation, annotation mode, allows you to add up to ten levels of text annotations to any portion of a sound recording.
